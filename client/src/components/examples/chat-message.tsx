Using the limit definition of a derivative:

\`\`\`math
f'(x) = lim(hâ†’0) [sin(x+h) - sin(x)] / h
\`\`\`

The key insight is using the trigonometric identity for sin(a+b).

**Step-by-step:**
1. Apply the angle addition formula
2. Factor and simplify
3. Take the limit

This is a fundamental derivative that you'll use throughout calculus!`}
